  Refine and improve the existing clinic note below by incorporating information from the new conversation chunk.
  
  Important guidelines:
  - Add new information to the appropriate sections of the note
  - Preserve all existing information in the note unless it is explicitly contradicted or corrected in the new chunk
  - Do not remove or replace existing content unless the new chunk indicates it is incorrect
  - Expand sections with additional details when new information is available
  - Build up the note progressively (for example, if the note only has a Patinet Information section, add other sections (HPI, ROS, PMHx, etc.) as they appear in conversation chunks)
  - Each chunk should improve the note with its specific information while maintaining the complete note structure
  - Maintain the clinical note format and structure throughout
  - Do not include any commentary, explanations, or meta-text about what was added or updated (e.g., do not say "Updated:", "Added:", "New information:", etc.)
  - If the new chunk contains no new information relevant to the note, output the previous note unchanged - do not write that no changes were made, just output the note as-is
  - If new information is available, incorporate it into the appropriate sections; if a section has no new information, leave it unchanged
  - Do not create an "Additional Information" section or similar - integrate all new information into the appropriate existing sections (HPI, ROS, PMHx, PLAN, etc.)
  - Output only the complete, final clinic note itself - it should be good enough to stand as the final note with no additional commentary or explanations
